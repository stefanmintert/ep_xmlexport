# XML Export for Etherpad Lite

This plug-in lets you export the content of a pad as XML. 

## Download and Install

Available on [github](https://github.com/stefanmintert/ep_xmlexport) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_xmlexport)

1. Install etherpad lite (EPL)
2. cd to your EPL install direcory
3. npm install ep_xmlexport

## Usage

You can use the plug-in via a graphical UI or via HTTP API calls. 

## UI

The plug-in adds itself to the list of export formats. Choose `XML` from list of formats. 

You can't control the XML output format using the GUI. If you need something different than the default XML, use the HTTP API instead.

TODO: Make the default configurable. 


## HTTP API

### Request URIs

#### Basic call, requesting generic EPL XML

    http://<hostPort>/p/<padName>/export/xml

#### Choose pad revision, requesting generic EPL XML

    http://<hostPort>/p/<padName>/<revision>/export/xml

#### Control output of line attributes (handling of EPL line marker, lmkr), requesting extended EPL XML

    http://<hostPort>/p/<padName>/<revision>/export/xml?lineattribs=true

Removes the line marker (asterisk with attribute lmkr) from a line and adds all lmkr attributes as XML attributes to the `line` element. `key`/`value` become the name/value of the correpsonding line attribute.  

#### Control output of lists markup, requesting extended EPL XML

    http://<hostPort>/p/<padName>/<revision>/export/xml?lists=true

Generates `list` and `item` elements. 

#### Regex matching of URIs, requesting extended EPL XML

    http://<hostPort>/p/<padName>/<revision>/export/xml?regex=true

Generates markup for [URIs](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). This feature is implemented because the original code, which this plug-in relies on, does a regex search for URIs; so I just kept this feature.

But the markup is generalized. For every URI in the pad text you'll get the following markup on export: `<matched-text key="uri" value="...">...</markup-text`. 

The generalized markup allows for an easy, later extension to match more patterns. 

#### Pretty printing XML

    http://<hostPort>/p/<padName>/<revision>/export/xml?pretty=true

Pretty prints XML with the help of [pretty-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-data). pretty-data is an optional dependency in package.json. If it's installed, you can use it. Otherwise the `pretty=true` argument has no effect.

I suggest to use pretty printing only for debugging purposes. It might insert some probably unwanted whitespace.

### Response

#### MIME type and encoding

Currently the MIME type `plain/xml` is used. A switch to `application/xml` might be reasonable. 

Little is known about dealing with the correct encoding ([BOM, XML declaration, HTTP header](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charencoding)) in EPL. If you think I'm doing wrong, let me know (fork & PR appreciated).

#### Message body

The plug-in produces [well-formed XML](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-well-formed).

You have the choice of exporting *generic EPL XML* or *extended EPL XML* (non-generic). What does this mean?

##### Generic EPL XML (default)

The generic export mode simply translates every line of pad content into a `line` element in XML, and every pad attribute into an `attribute` element in XML. `attribute` *elements* carry `key` and `value` XML *attributes*. (Don't get confused: EPL attributes are transformed to XML elements named "attribute"; their key/values are transformed to XML attributes.) 

You can validate the generic EPL XML against the [epl.dtd](epl.dtd).

##### Extended EPL XML

The XML format changes if at least one of the output control parameters are set to `true`. How the format changes is described for each of the control paramaters, see above.

There's only an experimental DTD for extended EPL XML: [epl-x.dtd](epl-x.dtd). Why experimental? Because the XML format changes with every new plug-in that introduces a new line marker attribute. BTW: The '-x' means "extended", not "experimental".

**Q: epl-x or epl? Which DTD should I use?**
**A:** Of course the answer is: That depends! epl.dtd seems to be pretty stable, and it should support a predictable output format. I simply try to export any part of the pad content in a canonical XML format. 

epl-x.dtd on the other hand contains some *decisions* that might be subject to discussion. What's "correct" handling of lists isn't easy to define, so maybe you want to deal with lists on your own. EPL allows some weird lists indentations. How should the plug-in behave in such a case? The plug-in relies on code from the latex plug-in to do some "reasonable" lists conversion. Some like it, some don't. 

I suggest to use as much from the epl-x export format as you like. I'll try to give you as much control as possible. 

## Exporting Comments

Since version 2.0.0 EPL-comments are supported. The supported plugin is [ep_comments_page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_comments_page). If installed, comments are exported along with their replies. There's no switch and no need to turn this feature on. But [jsxml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsxml) is required. It's listed as an optional dependency in package.json. If jsxml is not available, you won't get any comments in the exported XML.
