<!--
    DTD for extended XML export of Etherpad Lite
    according to ep_xmlexport plug-in

    Website: https://github.com/stefanmintert/ep_xmlexport

    Typical usage:

    <!DOCTYPE pad PUBLIC "TODO" "epl-x.dtd">
    <pad>...</pad>


    PLEASE NOTE:
    This DTD should only be used for validation of XML, that was
    exported from EPL with some output control parameter set to 'true'.
    Otherwise you should validate against generic epl.dtd.
    This DTD defines some element types for known EPL plug-ins.
    If you use EPL plug-ins, which were not considered when
    defining this DTD, validation of exported XML may fail.
    This is because unknown plug-ins might use EPL-attributes,
    that become XML attributes not declared in this DTD.
